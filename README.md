What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
 The problem that was being solved in this course is learning about different data structures for searching in a program. 
This invloved using algorithms to gain information about the different search methods. The three methods examined were 
hash table, binary search tree, and vector. This ended with having to choose which data structure would be best for searching
and changing a course list into alphaneumeric order.
 
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  The analysis of the three data structures was done after trying each of them in previous smaller projects. This made
the analysis of the different structures a little bit easier as I had the opportunity to try them. After the analysis 
and including that analysis with the charts helped me to choose the binary search tree for the final project.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  The earlier assignments I was able to overcome roadblocks with quick searches of online recourses or going back to 
zybooks for information. My most frequented online resource is Geeks for Geeks as I generally understand the explanations
of different aspect of the how to programming there. I also try to use the option in Visual Studio to search online when 
I encounter errors in the code. Unfortunately for the final project I was not able to find fixes to all the errors and 
did not gain a running code. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  This class is only the second time I have worked with C++, so everything in it is an expansion of my approach to 
programming. I gained more knowledge about the basic data structures which will help me in all of my future 
programming. Using algorithms to analyze data structures was brand new to me at the start ofthis course. I do not
fully understand how to interpret these algorithms with regards to programming yet but as I learn more I will be able 
to use them to help me choose the best data structures when planning a program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I am not sure exactly how this project has helped me with the way I write programs to be maintainable, readable, and 
adaptable. The first part of the project has helped me work on the planning phase. Instead of just doing the pseudocode,
I now know to look at what the potential runtime would be for a program. This makes the planning for it better. I did get
more practice with naming variables to help keep the program readable. Mu notes likely should have been better for 
maintainability, but I am working on that. With time I will be able to impliment these better but I am definately still a
work in progress.
